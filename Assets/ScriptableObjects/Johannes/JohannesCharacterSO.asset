  title: Johannes Itten
  dialogue:
  - "Ah, a new face, welcome! I\u2019m Johannes Itten, one of the first masters at
    this new school we\u2019re building. We\u2019re not just teaching students how
    to paint or build. We\u2019re teaching them how to see, how to feel form, how
    to truly understand color."
  - "My work here focuses on the foundations: line, shape, rhythm, and most importantly,
    color theory. I\u2019ve begun organizing colors not only by contrast, but by
    something more intuitive\u2026 more human. Think of the seasons: can\u2019t you
    feel the color of spring, or winter?"

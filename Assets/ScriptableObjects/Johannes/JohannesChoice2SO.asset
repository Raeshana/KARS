  choice: Color theory sounds abstract. What does that actually mean for design here
    at the Bauhaus?
  dialogue:
  - 'Color theory is more than a palette but a tool for structure. We train students
    to see contrast: warm vs cool, complementary, saturation. Understanding these
    relationships builds harmony, whether in a painting, a chair, or a building facade.'
  - "We can take this idea and apply it to how the seasons feel. What do you picture
    when I say Autumn, Spring, Winter, and Summer? Color theory is instinctual and
    completely human. Why don\u2019t you try to match colors to the season right
    now?"
